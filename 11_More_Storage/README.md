### More Storage 

##### I. Discussion - Class 10 Homework

##### II. Blog with CouchDB

##### III. Discussion - Final Project
*	Create a single web page experience that combines (1) data from at least one public web API and (2) data submitted by users that is stored in your own databse. Your final project should be uploaded to the web before class and should incorporate the following elements:
	* a public web API as a data source
	* a client-side js library other than jQuery and/or Underscore
	* server-side code (i.e. Node-Express)
	* data-storage (i.e. CouchDB on Cloudant)
	* at least one route that returns json data to the page  

*	In terms of 'data-storage', the idea is that a user will somehow contribute (i.e. input data) to your application. User input could come in many forms including but not limited to requests, comments, reviews, links, media, feedback, high scores, solutions and more. The input could be available only to that user through a personal link or could affect the entire experience of the application. It is up to you to decide!
