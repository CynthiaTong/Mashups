### The Server Plus Storage 

##### Discussion - Final Project
* Create a single web page experience that combines data from at least one public web API and data stored in your own databse. Your final project should be uploaded to the web before class and should incorporate the following elements:
  * a public web API as a data source
  * a client-side js library other than jQuery and/or Underscore
  * server-side code (i.e. Node-Express)
  * data-storage (i.e. CouchDB on Cloudant)

##### Creating your own API

* Main Page, Input Page, Data Page
