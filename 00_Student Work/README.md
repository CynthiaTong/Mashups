Mashups: Student Work
===============================

Assignment #1 - Due 9/30
-------------------------
Create a single web page experience that, upon user input, responds with data from at least 2 web apis. One possible approach to this assignment would be to design the experience around answering a question for the user. An example of this is [doineedanumbrella.com](http://doineedanumbrella.com/). An example of a mashup that pulls together data from two different apis is the InstaTimes example provided here in the class repo. Ulitmately, it's up to you what you want to build. But **(1)** a user needs to "trigger" an event, **(2)** data needs to be requested via AJAX from two APIs, and **(3)** the page should update appropriately. Your completed assignment should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file. 


Assignment #2 - Due 11/4
-------------------------
Create a single web page experience that leverages data from at least one public api and incorporates the use of at least one "interaction" library (i.e. D3, P5, Popcorn, etc.)


Final Project - Due 12/9
-------------------------
Your final project will require developing a comprehensive single page web experience that includes: 

* client-side and server-side web development
* at least one public web API as a data source
* at least one javascript “interaction” library
* database storage
* a public web API to access stored data
